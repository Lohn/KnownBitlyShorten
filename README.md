Bit.ly link shortener for Known
===============================

This plugin provides basic bit.ly link shortener support for the Known share tool.

The plugin uses both OAuth2 and Generic Access Token integration, so you can specify
a default shortener (via the GAT), but users can override this by linking to their own 
bitly accounts.

Usage
-----

* Install in your plugins
* Get a generic access token / OAuth keys from your bitly settings page
* Configure the plugin via the bitly page in the admin panel
* Now, whenever you use the Known share button, links will be shortened.
