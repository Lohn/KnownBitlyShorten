Bit.ly link shortener for Known
===============================

This plugin provides basic bit.ly link shortener support for the Known share tool.

Currently it uses the generic access token, so you can currently only link one Bitly account per Known install.

Usage
-----

* Install in your plugins
* Get a generic access token from your bitly settings page
* Configure the plugin via the bitly page in the admin panel
* Now, whenever you use the Known share button, links will be shortened.

Todo
----

* OAuth bindings for more than one account per install. Will implement if I have time/there's a demand, otherwise pull requests are accepted :)
